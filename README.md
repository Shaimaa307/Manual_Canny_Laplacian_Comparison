# Manual_Canny_Laplacian_Comparison
This notebook compares manual implementations of key computer vision algorithms with OpenCV versions. It includes Laplacian sharpening and a full four-stage Canny pipeline. Using MAD and pixel similarity, the manual Canny achieved 82.55% alignment with OpenCV, validating correctness with remaining differences due to OpenCV’s internal optimizations.
